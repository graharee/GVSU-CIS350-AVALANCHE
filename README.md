# 1. Introduction
LectureBot aims to help students cultivate a better learning experience within the classroom. This application allows students to record lectures (in-person or online), edit the transcripts, and save it as a text file for later studying. Not only does LectureBot offer a way to record a live lecture, students are able to get a written transcript of a recorded lecture, simply by uploading a .wav file. Lastly, to further enhance the user's learning experience, Lecture Bot allows users to be able to translate their lecture into a non-charcter language of their choosing.

# 5. Conclusion
Overall, we believe that LectureBot helps improve students learning experiences. Instead of hurrying to write down notes, students are able to relax and know that LectureBot will handle it for them. We hope that LectureBot can be used to help the stress of busy students while also helping them in learning more. Of course, there is always room for improvement when it comes to app development, and this something we will continue to strive to do.
