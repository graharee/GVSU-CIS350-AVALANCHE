## 1. Abstract 
School is difficult, students often face challenges that effect their ability to fully engage with lecture content. These include mental fatigue, difficulty concentrating during long class periods, and instructors who speak too quickly for traditional note-taking methods to keep up. Such issues can lead to incomplete notes, missed information, and added stress when reviewing material outside of class. To address these problems, we developed **LectureBot** that acts as an additional pair of ears for the student. **LectureBot** is designed to capture and process spoken lecture content, providing students with organized summaries of what was discussed. By reducing the cognitive load during class and supporting review afterward, **LectureBot** enhances the overall learning experience. It empowers students to focus on understanding, and ensures that no important detail is lost.

## 2. Introduction  
**LectureBot** aims to help students cultivate a better learning experience within the classroom. This application allows students to record lectures (in-person or online), edit the transcripts, and save it as a text file for later studying. Not only does **LectureBot** offer a way to record a live lecture, students are able to get a written transcript of a recorded lecture, simply by uploading a .wav file. Lastly, to further enhance the user's learning experience, Lecture Bot allows users to be able to translate their lecture into a non-charcter language of their choosing.

## 6. Conclusion  
Overall, we believe that **LectureBot** helps improve students learning experiences. Instead of hurrying to write down notes, students are able to relax and know that **LectureBot** will handle it for them. We hope that **LectureBot** can be used to help the stress of busy students while also helping them in learning more. Of course, there is always room for improvement when it comes to app development, and this something we will continue to strive to do.
