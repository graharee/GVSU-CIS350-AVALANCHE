# Introduction

The concept behind our project is to develop a mobile app that captures spoken audio and converts it into readable text after a recording session. This app is specifically designed with college students in mind, offering a convenient and efficient tool for recording lectures.

The main functionality of the app is user-friendly: a student opens the app and taps a “Record” button to begin capturing audio during a lecture. Once the recording is complete, the app processes the audio and displays a full transcription of the lecture directly on the screen. In addition to viewing the text within the app, users will have the option to download the transcription as a text file for future references.

**Key Features**
+ Mobile App 
+ Downloading capabilities
+ Keep record of lectures

# Anticipated Problems

One potential challenge we anticipate throughout the course of this project is a general lack of prior experience in key areas. For many members of our team, this will be the first time developing an app or working with audio-to-text conversion technologies. As a result, much of our progress will rely on a continuous learning process, requiring us to research new tools, experiment with unfamiliar methods, and problem-solve in real time. While this presents a challenge, we view it as an opportunity to expand our skill sets and grow as developers.
