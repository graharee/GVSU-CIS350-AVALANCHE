# Introduction

The concept behind our project is to develop a mobile app that captures spoken audio and converts it into readable text after a recording session. This app is specifically designed with college students in mind, offering a convenient and efficient tool for recording lectures.

The main functionality of the app is user-friendly: a student opens the app and taps a “Record” button to begin capturing audio during a lecture. Once the recording is complete, the app processes the audio and displays a full transcription of the lecture directly on the screen. In addition to viewing the text within the app, users will have the option to download the transcription as a text file for future references.

**Key Features**
+ It being a Mobile App
+ Downloading capabilities
+ Keep record of lectures on documents in the app

# Anticipated Technologies

- A computer to have the IDE for Python.

# Method/Approach

The mehtod we plan on using is called Kanban. We will have a shared Google Docs that has 4 secitons. The first being the TO-DO section where what needs to be done in the order that it needs to be done in. The second being the DOING seciton where we can keep track of who is doing what. The third being the TESTING section where we can see who is testing what. The last seciton being the DONE section. This is how we can keep track of our progress. We will also be meeting every so often to see what is working and what is not working (Scram meeting), so we can change things up, if needed. 

# Estimated Timeline

+ Create a plan of action (Week 1)
+ Delegate team roles (Week 1)
+ Create project proposal (Week 1)
+ Research (Week 1)
+ Designing possible UIs (Week 2)
+ Creating app (Week 2 - Week 3)
+ Creating formula to convert audio to text (Week 2 - Week 3)
+ Testing (Week 4)
+ Final project presentation (Week 4)

# Anticipated Problems

One potential challenge we anticipate throughout the course of this project is a general lack of prior experience in key areas. For many members of our team, this will be the first time developing an app or working with audio-to-text conversion technologies. As a result, much of our progress will rely on a continuous learning process, requiring us to research new tools, experiment with unfamiliar methods, and problem-solve in real time. While this presents a challenge, we view it as an opportunity to expand our skill sets and grow as developers.
