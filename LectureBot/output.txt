of students in our educational Community Judith thank you so much for joining us and congratulations on your recent honor thank you it's a pleasure to be here thank you I'm looking so forward to this conversation because you know sometimes in our University will think about publishing scholarship and will related to The Faculty scholar role and how important it is to the work of teaching can you just talk about the way you think about it honestly you know I would love to talk about it because I have a passion for research I actually find research and teaching they have to go together I'm a much better teacher thanks to my research and my Consulting work in the community what is happening is what do you graduate from a PhD program you're doing a lot of the beauty of academics you can do what you want and over the years have gone into applied learning applied research like in supply chain you know like lean and Six Sigma when you introduced to Concepts in the classroom people stare at you because they have no idea what it is but when I bring into research the interviews have had with companies that bring case studies bring data get excited to see that transformation in their faces and that's why I believe you know that keeps me thinking you know and that's why I like to do more and more research applied learning so that I can share it with my corporate Partners as well as my students you know it creates such an important sort of line of sight for students who are sitting there in the theoretical and trying to figure out what does this mean when I walk out the door and I start my practice when you talk about applied learning like how do you think about that say a little bit more about what you mean when you say that like learning in the classrooms you know it's very nice initially when I was a junior faculty it was more case studies bringing in speakers but what is often more Project based learning and more importantly I believe you know giving up my students to maximum exposure to what the real world is so I bring in guest speakers but I tell the guest speakers not to talk about the companies but bring a real problem which they are encountering at work and make the student in the classroom and also my projects last semester I had a great ball because we do in my teaching Capstone Advanced supply chain coast and I made my students work with two other teams from school of Economics so each of them is a lot of 15 people working on a research project and I think that was tremendous learning for our students because it made him realize that the different ways to communicate and it also replicated what a project in Wyoming would be in the real world yes so true and I think we have something like 84 global companies in West Michigan so many of our companies have that kind of footprint and just some knowledge of working Beyond cultures Beyond Time Zone on real work how does it influence your Consulting how does that work come into the way in which you work inside an environment yeah see what happened I was doing research I keep my mind open I was doing research with academic scholarships and even Consultants the beauty of working with Consultants letters reference letters which aligned with the company's needs all that adds up and creates maximum value I think I just love the way that you give a global Concepts like really knowing the companies and then show how it can create advantages for us as a universe varsity and advantages for our students by being able to really speak to their business issues when you're recommending a student that's just so profound I'm just so appreciative of you you've worked on a number of the president's initiatives and teams I know that Dean Lawson thinks very highly of your work your obviously very accomplished thank you so much for sharing some of your insights with us it's a pleasure every morning when I wake up I'm excited to go to work you know I look forward to it sometimes when I go out of town you know I enjoy but after the week I think we need to go back to work you know I think I'm getting bored now you teaching research I love going back to the classroom meeting with the students you know teaching the students it's just been fun Journey 34 years and I'm grateful to Grand Valley for giving me that opportunity and we're grateful to you for all the work you've
